            <h1>Our story</h1>
            <p>Starting off as Guitar Club, we were a 2 person team. It consisted of Justin and Addison. Gradually, Justin and Addison searched for more people, and Derek joined. We practiced every Friday, but we lacked a bass and a singer. At last, the joining of Daisy, and soon thereafter, Megan, completed our band. 
    We had open practices every Friday, so students from Sierramont Middle School could hear us wherever we played. We even got a sound of approval from our principal! At last, our first chance at a performance came. We auditioned and performed at the annual student talent show, earning the attention of many of the students. 
    Next came high school. We broke up into two schools, with Megan at Independence HS and the rest of the band at Piedmont Hills HS. For a while, school duties took over. At last, we had a reunion practice, and practices have gotten more and more regular after that. 
    We've performed at many school club functions, including ones for CSF, UNICEF, and Key.</p>
